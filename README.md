    <h1>The Hokages of Konoha</h1>
  <img src="x-hokages.jpg" alt="hokages"/> <p>The Hokages are some of the most skillfull people to live. The first Hokage, Hashirama Senju, was the only user of the wood style technique. He could heal his body without weaving hand seals. He mastered all five chakara natures, mastering two chakara natures is extremly difficult. The second Hokage, Tobirama senju, is brother to the first hokage, he was able to use water techniques as good or even better than a mizukage. He also matered all five chakara natures. The third Hokage, Hiruzen Sarutobi, is the student of the first two hokages. Just like his teachers, Hiruzen is one of the strongest shinobi to ever live. Hiruzen as well mastered all five chakara natures but was better at using fire techniques. The Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze, was feared during the third great shinobi war as the yellow flash of the leaf. He mastered two of the strongest jutsus that the second hokage made, the flying thunder god technique(flying raijin jutsu) and the shadow clone technique. Minatos life was cut short because of an attack on the hidden leaf the day his son was born ending his and his wifes life. The fith hokage and one of the legandary sanin, Princess Tsunade Senju, was the grandauter of the first hokage. She is the most skillful shinobi in the medical feild. She can also use the mitotic reanimation, 100 healings jutsu. This is also the jutsu the the first hokage used to heal without weaving hand signs. The Sixth Hokage, Kakashi Hatake, is the son of the feared Sakumo Hatake and student to the Fourth Hokage. He's one of the most skilled shinobi in his generation, becoming a member of the anbu black ops at age thirteen. The Seventh Hokage, Naruto Uzumaki, is the son of the fourth hokage and student to the sixth hokage. He has surpased all previous hokages in power and skill.
